        <h5>Refund Policy</h5>

        <p>
          All sales are final, and we do not offer refunds for the paid period
          of services already availed by the client. Complaints or
          dissatisfaction regarding the quality of services during the paid
          period shall not entitle the client to any refund or compensation. As
          per SEBI guidelines, if a client requests to cancel the subscription,
          a refund shall only be issued for the unused portion of the
          subscription period. The refund will be calculated on a pro-rata
          basis, deducting the charges for the services already availed,
          including applicable taxes and administrative fees. Refunds will not
          be provided for the period of services already availed, irrespective
          of the client's satisfaction with the recommendations or the outcome
          of trades. Investment in securities markets are subject to market
          risks. Profits and losses incurred due to the use of our
          recommendations are solely the responsibility of the client. By
          subscribing to our services and making payment, the client
          acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to the refund
          policy, as well as the disclaimer, disclosure, and other terms
          mentioned on our website.
